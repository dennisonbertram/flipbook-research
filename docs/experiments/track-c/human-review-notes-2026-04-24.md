# Human Review Notes

## Human-Positive / Metric-Negative Case

Run:

```text
outputs/track-c/20260424T174026078431Z-c2-lite-text-static-layout-element-frame-scale-c26-word-rect-r010-1280x736-s4500/output.mp4
```

User review:

```text
"this one looks very good"
```

Automated eval:

```text
scenario:          frame-scale-strong
anchor mode:       word
element ratio:     0.10
OCR token-F1:      0.1143
render_33_wall_ms: 3172.452
encode_ms:         526.506
segment_wall_ms:   3698.959
```

Interpretation:

- OCR is likely underrating this run because the visual output reads better than the token match suggests.
- Word-sized support regions preserve local visual context better than glyph-only alpha and may avoid dragging large unrelated illustration regions.
- The current implementation is too slow because `105` word patches are rendered sequentially for every frame.

Decision:

```text
Do not discard word anchors.
Prioritize batched word-anchor rendering.
Add human-review status to future eval summaries.
```

Next experiments:

```text

c28-line-batched-r005
```

## Positive Low-Aggression Motion Baseline

Run:

```text
outputs/track-c/20260424T151017Z-c2-lite-text-1280x736-s4500/output.mp4
```

User review:

```text
"less aggressive motion, but the animation did work well with the text"
```

Automated eval:

```text
scenario:          still-full-resize / gentle learned motion
flow_scale:        0.005
OCR token-F1:      0.8545
render_33_wall_ms: 301.365
encode_ms:         633.911
segment_wall_ms:   935.276
motion_delta:      0.0158
loop_error:        0.0008
```

Interpretation:

- Gentle learned motion can coexist with stable, readable text.
- The failure boundary is not animation itself; it is aggressive resize/reflow pressure and large coordinate deformation.
- The eval plan should keep separate "pleasant motion" scenarios from stress scenarios.

Decision:

```text
Keep C2.1 as the positive gentle-motion baseline.
Add a gentle-motion ladder so the pleasant-motion boundary is measured, not guessed.
```
